							<h2>Under-Graduate Projects   <span class="logo icon fa-laptop-code"></span></h2>
							<p>Along with basic circuit analysis, various projects have been undertaken during his academic career. Some of these include using PIC18F microcontrollers, LCDs, and fans to simulate rpm, and a traffic intersection. Additionally, there has been extensive analysis of Fourier Series and Voltage Gains across various devices including but not limited to transistors, inductors, capacitors, and resistors. </p>
